Comparison of Binary Search Tree, AVL, and (2,4) Trees

Write code that will implement a Binary Search Tree, AVL, and (2,4) Trees.  Compare the runtime of these data structures in terms of the operations, insert, search and delete.  Populate the data structures randomly just like your previous experimental analysis.  Plot the runtimes in Excel and label appropriately.
